# Opening the solution file
 * Since the scraper is made using **.NET 6.0 / C#10** you will need Visual Studio 2022 in order to open and compile the project.

# Usage
 * Open the application, paste a valid 4chan thread link and click **scrape**.  
 * I recommend to use it on small threads (30 or less images) since it's downloading files slowly.

# Directories
 * The scraper creates only one directory on launch that is located at **C:\\Scraper**

# Todo
 * Thread specific directories.
 * More information about the thread (filename, preview url, subject).
 * Option to export the thread information as json.
