# Image-Scraper
 Downloads images from 4chan threads

# Usage
 Open the application, paste a valid 4chan thread link and click **scrape**.  
 I recommend to use it on small threads (30 or less images) since it's downloading files slowly.

# Directories
 The scraper creates only one directory on launch that is located at **C:\\Scraper**

# Todo
 * Thread specific directories.
 * More information about the thread (filename, preview url, subject).
 * Option to export the thread information as json.
